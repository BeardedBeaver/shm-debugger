# Shared Memory Debugging tools (shm-debugger)

This set of tools provides a comprehensive solution for debugging apps that rely on
reading data from shared memory. It allows recording and replaying data, making it easier
to analyze and troubleshoot issues. Primarily aimed for racing simulators,
but can be expanded to use with any app with similar usage pattern
(read data updated by app in shared memory).

* [ ] AC and ACC support
* [ ] R3E support?

# Bundled tools

## Dumper

This tool reads shared memory with the specified frequency and saves
raw data to file. It uses compression to make files smaller. Usually
40 minutes iRacing file written with 5 Hz frequency is about 100MB.

```
Allowed options:
--help              Produce help message
--fps arg           Frames per second (default =5)
```

## Emulator

This tool reads the specified file (generated by dumper) and outputs
data to shared memory as if it was generated by the simulator allowing
third-party apps to connect to shared memory.

```
Allowed options:
  --help                Produce help message
  --input-file arg      Input file name (required)
```

# Supported simulators

- iRacing

AC and ACC are coming later

# Dependencies

- boost
- zlib
- GTest

# Build

## Using conan 1.x

```
conan install . -if cmake-build-release-visual-studio/dependencies/conan --build missing -s compiler="Visual Studio" -s compiler.version=16 -s cppstd=20 -s build_type=Release
cmake -S . -B cmake-build-release-visual-studio -D "CMAKE_MODULE_PATH=cmake-build-release-visual-studio/dependencies/conan"
cmake --build
```

Debug

```
conan install . -if cmake-build-debug-visual-studio/dependencies/conan --build missing -s compiler="Visual Studio" -s compiler.version=16 -s cppstd=20 -s build_type=Debug
```

## Repo content

- `shmd-lib` - main application library
- `shmd-tests` - GTest-based unit tests for `shmd-lib`
- `shmd-dumper` - a commandline tool for dumping simulator-generated data to disk
- `shmd-emulator` - a commandline tool for reading dumps and streaming data to shared memory as if it
  was generated by the simulator
